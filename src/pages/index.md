    “_The new tools of our oppression_”, is one way the world's top researchers and industry leaders have described the threat that artificial intelligence poses to humankind.

    From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence is progressing rapidly. Will communities of color be prepared for AI related opportunities and challenges impacting their neighborhoods?

  section2: |-
    While no one can foresee exactly how this will play out, a mountain of evidence suggests that just like during past technological leaps, the fears —though realistic — can be managed through education and dialogue.
    The long-term impact of AI on communities of color is unknown. Conversations about AI are absent in the communities most directly affected by automation and other AI tools.

    As the Artificial Intelligence market reaches $70 billion by 2020, humans' fear is in the rise. Why do humans fear AI?
    AI can only become what humans want it to become. Humans are tasked with coding into their AI creations. If the mass population is becoming anxious about AI this is due to fear of the unknown. It is also perhaps due to too little information available out there on the benefits that AI brings in order to balance with those believing AI will destroy society.

    ### McKinsey & Company - Blacks in the fast-food, retail and customer-service
    industries — especially those in "support roles" like cashiers, office clerks,
    stockroom laborers and call-center representatives — are most vulnerable to their
    jobs disappearing as companies invest more in labor-replacing technologies. In
    all, African-Americans are projected to lose a total of 132,000 jobs between now
    and 2030 due to automation, researchers said.  Of course, other groups are also
    under threat. Latinos could see roughly a quarter of their jobs automated out
    of existence, according to McKinsey, while Asians, whites and others will also
    be affected.

    ### Cities Struggle to Prepare African Americans, Latinos for the Future Workforce – U.S. News, 2019
    A new study details how different cities are educating and training their populations most impacted by job automation.
    Despite city efforts to train their residents for workforce changes as automation threatens millions of jobs, they are struggling to equip their most vulnerable populations: African Americans and Latinos.
    In a [recent study](https://www.ourmayors.org/Resources/Future-of-Work-Initiative) released by the African American Mayors Association, which represents more than 500 African American mayors across the U.S., researchers examined three cities – Gary, [Indiana](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/indiana); Columbia, [South Carolina](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-carolina); and Long Beach, [California](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california) – to see how successful they've been in preparing students and workers to succeed
    in the changing labor market. What they found: the initiatives aren't effectively reaching the populations most likely to lose their jobs to automation.

    ### A biased medical algorithm favored white people for health-care programs - MIT Technology Review, Oct 25, 2019
    A [study](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614626/a-biased-medical-algorithm-favored-white-people-for-healthcare-programs/) has highlighted the risks inherent in using historical data to train machine-learning algorithms to make predictions.
