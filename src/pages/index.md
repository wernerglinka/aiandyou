  “_The new tools of our oppression_”, is one way the world's top researchers and industry leaders have described the threat that artificial intelligence poses to humankind. Will artificial intelligence (AI) enhance our lives or completely upend them?  Will communities of color be prepared for AI related opportunities and changes impacting their neighborhoods? Community outreach is necessary to prepare for changes and opportunities of AI!

  While no one can foresee exactly how this will play out, a mountain of evidence suggests that just like during past technological leaps, the fears -- though realistic -- can be managed through education and dialogue. The lesson of history is that scary stories about job-stealing machines lead to focusing on the short-term pain caused by new technologies while minimizing the even greater long-term benefits.
  AI impacts every global community member, yet its long-term impact on communities of color is unknown. Conversations about AI and employment, medicine, education, transportation and more are absent in the communities most directly affected by automation and other AI related activities. Some understand there is considerable potential for altering business processes, but most are not clear how AI could be deployed within their own jobs, communities and everyday life.

    As the Artificial Intelligence market reaches $70 billion by 2020, humans' fear is in the rise. Why do humans fear AI?
    AI can only become what humans want it to become. Humans are tasked with coding into their AI creations. If the mass population is becoming anxious about AI this is due to fear of the unknown. It is also perhaps due to too little information available out there on the benefits that AI brings in order to balance with those believing AI will destroy society.

  ## The Story
  Susan Gonzales, CEO, worked closely with AI engineers on the Accessibility and Social Good teams at Facebook when she led Community Engagement for the company.  Susan experienced the positive outcomes of AI through this work.  When she left Facebook to work as a consultant, she continued to explore AI and saw the consequences of unintended bias of AI in the community in additional to its social good purposes.

  Susan was retained by Neuro Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) to lead diversity and inclusion work at the global conference in Montreal in 2019.  Susan led the first global town hall discussing AI and Diversity and was joined by the leaders of LatinxinAI, BlackinAI, WomeninMachineLearning (WIML) and QueerinAI.  Over time, Susan realized that the science community has conversations about AI and its impact on the community yet, outreach and communications in communities of color was not taking place. Susan identified the need to bridge AI leaders with communities of color to discuss AI and social good, unintended biases and impact on everyday life.  Susan launched AIandyou.org educate communities of color about all aspects of AI.

communities: "## AI and Commuities of Color\n### McKinsey & Company \nBlacks in the
  fast-food, retail and customer-service industries — especially those in \"support
  roles\" like cashiers, office clerks, stockroom laborers and call-center representatives
  — are most vulnerable to their jobs disappearing as companies invest more in labor-replacing
  technologies. In all, African-Americans are projected to lose a total of 132,000
  jobs between now and 2030 due to automation, researchers said.  Of course, other
  groups are also under threat. Latinos could see roughly a quarter of their jobs
  automated out of existence, according to McKinsey, while Asians, whites and others
  will also be affected.\n\n### Cities Struggle to Prepare African Americans, Latinos
  for the Future Workforce – U.S. News, 2019\nA new study details how different cities
  are educating and training their populations most impacted by job automation.\nDespite
  city efforts to train their residents for workforce changes as automation threatens
  millions of jobs, they are struggling to equip their most vulnerable populations:
  African Americans and Latinos.\nIn a [recent study](https://www.ourmayors.org/Resources/Future-of-Work-Initiative) released
  by the African American Mayors Association, which represents more than 500 African
  American mayors across the U.S., researchers examined three cities – Gary, [Indiana](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/indiana);
  Columbia, [South Carolina](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/south-carolina);
  and Long Beach, [California](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/california) –
  to see how successful they've been in preparing students and workers to succeed
  in the changing labor market. What they found: the initiatives aren't effectively
  reaching the populations most likely to lose their jobs to automation.\n"
