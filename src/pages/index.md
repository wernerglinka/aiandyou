intro:
  section1: |
    _From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence is progressing rapidly. Will marginalized communities be prepared for AI related opportunities and challenges impacting their lives?_
  section2: |-
    While no one can foresee exactly how this will play out, a mountain of evidence suggests that just like during past technological leaps, the fears —though realistic — can be managed through education and dialogue. The long-term impact of AI on marginalized communities is unknown. Engagement around AI is absent in the communities most directly affected by automation and other AI tools.
